# PlaceIndex

**Real Estate Market Intelligence • Area Investment Index Dashboard**

## What is PlaceIndex?

PlaceIndex is a research initiative exploring what a real estate area investment index could look like. Think of it like the S&P 500 but for neighborhoods — a standardized benchmark system that lets you compare localities side-by-side using consistent, data-driven metrics.

This repo is a working space for planning artifacts, research frameworks, prototypes, and architectural docs. It's where we're figuring out what should be built, why it matters, and how to make it real. The code here is pre-production by design — once we validate the core idea and secure funding, we'll move to building the actual product.

## Why This Exists

Real estate investing today feels stuck in an analog world. You've got plenty of data, sure, but it's fragmented. Investors make decisions based on gut feelings, outdated comps, or a handful of metrics that don't tell the full story. Neighborhoods get described by anecdotes instead of objective signals.

PlaceIndex is an attempt to change that. We're building an intelligence layer that can tell you:
- Where are prices actually moving and why?
- Which neighborhoods have rental yields that justify the investment?
- How liquid is this market — can you actually buy and sell quickly?
- What's the trajectory of infrastructure and economic development here?

Instead of comparing a dozen spreadsheets or calling your broker, you'd have a transparent index that reflects real market dynamics. That's useful for retail investors making their first real estate bet, institutions deploying capital at scale, and platforms that need to show their users objective area quality signals.

## What's in This Repo

This is all planning-stage work. Here's what you'll find:

**Market & Opportunity Research**
- Competitive landscape analysis and validation studies
- AI-guided market sizing and feasibility assessments

**Data Strategy**
- Prioritized list of data sources and coverage mapping
- Quality scoring frameworks and simulation prototypes
- Feasibility estimates for data collection and validation

**Scoring Models**
- Draft scoring methodologies for area investment indices
- Weighting strategies and synthetic simulations
- Stress-test frameworks to validate model robustness

**Analytics & Prediction**
- Exploratory notebooks for time-series forecasting
- Scenario simulations and risk modeling
- Bias assessment frameworks for AI components

**Product & UX**
- Visualization concepts and dashboard wireframes
- Feature prioritization and user persona research
- UI direction and interaction patterns

**Infrastructure & Architecture**
- Cloud provider comparison and cost modeling
- Scalability planning and performance benchmarks
- Technology decision documentation

**Risk, Governance & Roadmap**
- Regulatory and compliance risk mapping
- Ethical considerations for algorithmic bias
- MVP strategy and path to scale
- Governance frameworks and checklists

**Research & References**
- Glossary of real estate and investment terminology
- Data vendor evaluation logs and citations
- Reference materials and research links

## What This Is Not

This repo does *not* contain:

- A live application you can visit
- Production backend or frontend code
- Trained ML models ready for inference
- ETL pipelines or data infrastructure

Those will exist once we've validated the concept, made funding decisions, and committed to building the product. Right now, we're still in the thinking and planning phase.
